## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Image Not Showing?**

1. **Check if published:**
   - Make sure you clicked "Publish" in Sanity Studio
   - Draft changes won't appear on the website

2. **Clear cache:**
   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
   - Or clear browser cache

3. **Check image format:**
   - Ensure it's JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - Try re-uploading if corrupted

4. **Check file size:**
   - Very large files (>5MB) may not load
   - Compress the image before uploading

### **Image Looks Distorted?**

1. **Check aspect ratio:**
   - Square or portrait images work best
   - Very wide images may be cropped

2. **Use hotspot feature:**
   - In Sanity Studio, click on the image
   - Adjust the "hotspot" to focus on the important part
   - This ensures the best part of the image is visible

### **Image Loading Slowly?**

1. **Optimize image:**
   - Compress before uploading
   - Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim
   - Target file size: 200-500KB

2. **Check internet connection:**
   - Sanity CDN should be fast
   - If slow, check your connection

## 📝 Example Alt Text
